- Similarity clustering
- Recommendation engine
- Search analytics and optimization
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination with cursors
- Filtering and sorting standards
- API versioning strategy (v1, v2, etc.)
```

### Data Consistency
- **ACID Properties**: MongoDB transactions for critical operations
- **Eventual Consistency**: For non-critical updates
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamps
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation at API and database levels

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# Example error response structure
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "details": {
      "field": "content",
      "issue": "Content exceeds maximum length"
    },
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Abstract database operations, support multiple providers
- **Scale Challenges**: Implement horizontal scaling from day 1
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup and replication strategy
- **Security Breaches**: Defense in depth, regular security audits

### Business Risks
- **Cost Overruns**: Implement cost monitoring and alerts
- **Compliance Violations**: Regular compliance audits and automated checks
- **Performance Degradation**: Proactive monitoring and capacity planning

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Embedding Cost Reduction
```
Strategies:
1. Local Models: 90% cost reduction vs OpenAI API
2. Caching: Store computed embeddings, avoid recomputation
3. Batching: Process multiple entries in single API calls
4. Compression: Use quantized embeddings where appropriate
```

### Infrastructure Optimization
- Reserved instance pricing for predictable workloads
- Spot instances for batch processing jobs
- Storage tiering (hot/warm/cold data)
- CDN usage for static content

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- API Response Time (P95 < 200ms)
- Search Accuracy (>95% relevance)
- System Availability (99.9%)
- Error Rate (<0.1%)

### Business KPIs
- User Adoption Rate
